# Kanye-Quote-Twitter-Bot

A little project to familiarize myself with using different APIs and libraries. \
Utilizes Tweepy library (https://www.tweepy.org/) and https://kanye.rest/ (Andrew Jazbec @ajzbc) to tweet Kanye West quotes.

# Usage
Send a tweet to @DavenBot with the hashtag #kanye to have a quote sent to you, or follow the account where tweets are sent out within a random 24-36 hour interval. 

## Deployment
This twitter bot was deployed to Amazon AWS (EC2 instance) running a docker image.
